        <h1>What are cognitive skills?</h1>
        <h3>Cognitive skills, or cognitive abilities, are the ways that your brain remembers, reasons, holds attention,
            solves problems, thinks, reads and learns. Your cognitive abilities help you process new information by
            taking that information and distributing it into the appropriate areas in your brain. When you need that
            information later, your brain also uses cognitive skills to retrieve and use that information. By developing
            cognitive skills, you help your brain complete this process more quickly and efficiently, and you ensure
            that you understand and effectively process that new information.

            In the workplace, cognitive skills help you interpret data, remember team goals, pay attention during an
            important meeting and more. These skills help you recall previous information that may relate to your
            organization’s goals and help you make important connections between old and new information so you work
            more effectively.</h3>

        <h1>Importance of cognitive skills</h1>
        <h3>Cognitive skills can be categorised as long-term memory, visual processing, processing speed, sustained
            attention, divided attention, working memory, logic and reasoning, selective attention, and auditory
            processing.

            These skills matter because they help you recognise patterns, analyse and solve problems, understand and
            comprehend information, brainstorm effectively, and have focused attention. Moreover, strengthening your
            cognitive skills and building your logic and reasoning skills can help you develop creative solutions to
            challenges.</h3>
